        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, ,minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 pounds beef top sirlion steaks</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
            <li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
